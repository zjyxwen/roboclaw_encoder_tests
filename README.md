# roboclaw_encoder_tests
used for testing roboclaw encoder readings in different scenarios. motor used is RoboClaw 2x15A Motor Controller 

-----

roboclaw.py and packet_serial.py are from official roboclaw documentation
driving.py will both autonomously drive the robot and print encoder readings
encoder.py will purely print out encoder readings-- ideal for manual testing
